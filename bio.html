            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <div class="text-content">
                <p>Born in January 1998, to <strong><em>Mother</em>&nbsp; Christine Belknap</strong>&nbsp; aged 19 and <strong><em>Father</em>&nbsp;Brian Garrett</strong>&nbsp; aged 21, both of whom would go onto live very unstable lives, suffering from opiate addictions as well as eventually spending time  
                incarcerated.<br>
                    <p>
                    <strong>Grayson Garrett</strong>&nbsp; was raised by his <strong><em>Maternal Great-Grandfather</em>&nbsp; Arthur Davis</strong>&nbsp; a WWII Air/Army Veteran. Being raised by a <strong><em>Great-Grandparent </em></strong>&nbsp; played a significant role in the views he holds on the world. He also spent weekends 
                    at his <strong><em> Paternal Grandparents</em></strong>&nbsp; home where he would be introduced to the world of Video Games & Computers. <strong>Gary Marino</strong>&nbsp; his <strong><em>Paternal Grandfather </em></strong>&nbsp; was an early adopter of the custom gaming desktop. Utilizing xeon light bars
                    before the popularization of LEDs in Gaming Computers of today. Seeing his <strong><em>paternal-grandfather</em></strong>&nbsp; tinker with what to many can feel like a "black box" played a significant role in inspiring Grayson to aspire towards acareer in Computer Science. Challenging him to want to understand how things
                    work, solving problems to better maintain and even alter systems around him to better suit his needs.This innate interest naturally led to a passion for technology, from the intricate dance of software to the tangible world of hardware and microcontrollers.
                    </p>
                    <p>Grayson's life is one of overcoming challenges and learning through hands-on application. Believing strongly in <em>sustainability</em> and <em>self-sufficiency</em>, he applies his skills to not only create but also to repair, repurpose, and empower others. Whether it's unlocking the full potential of a device, teaching others to become more tech-savvy, or finding value in discarded items, Grayson is dedicated to innovating practical and adaptive solutions for the dynamic challenges of our modern world.</p>
